| common/config/rush/shrinkwrap.yaml                   | The shrinkwrap file when your package manager is PNPM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Temporary files created by Rush

| File(s)                       | What it does                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| common/temp/install-run/...   | Storage for the **install-run.js** and **install-run-rush.js** scripts. See [Enabling CI builds](../maintainer/enabling_ci_builds.md).       |
| common/temp/node_modules/...  | The installed packages. This is a plain old `npm install` output, with no symlinks in this tree.                                             |
| common/temp/npm-cache/...     | A local NPM cache will be created here. Rush does not use the global NPM cache due to its concurrency problems.                              |
| common/temp/npm-local/...     | Based on the **npmVersion** setting, Rush will install NPM in your home directory and create a symlink to it for each repo that requests it. |
| common/temp/npm-tmp/...       | Temporary files created by NPM during installation.                                                                                          |
| common/temp/projects/...      | Synthetic projects referenced by **common/temp/package.json**.                                                                               |
| common/temp/rush-recycler/... | Used to speed up recursive deletes.                                                                                                          |
| common/temp/last-install.flag | Don't worry about this file. It tracks the timestamp of the last successful `rush install`.                                                  |
| common/temp/package.json      | The common package definition.                                                                                                               |
| common/temp/rush-link.json    | Don't worry about this file. It is created whenever you run `rush link`, and read by later commands such as "rush build".                    |
